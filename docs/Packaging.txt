Packaging Performous is very easy, using CMake's packaging facility. Normally you
will follow the instructions below, but if a distribution or OS is not yet
supported, you will need to add dependencies and possibly other data to
cmake/performous-packaging.cmake.


Source packages:
- Remove any extra files in source tree (the ones from Git and an the build folder can be kept)

cmake ../
make package_source


Binary packages:
- Preferrably you should use a LiveCD or a clean install as build platform
- If smaller binary packages are preferred, use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

cmake ../
make package
