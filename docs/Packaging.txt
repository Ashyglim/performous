Packaging Performous is very easy, using CMake's packaging facility. Normally you
will follow the instructions below, but if a distribution or OS is not yet
supported, you will need to add dependencies and possibly other data to
cmake/performous-packaging.cmake.


Source packages:
- Remove any extra files in source tree (the ones from SVN and build folder can be kept)

cmake ../
make package_source


Binary packages:
- Preferrably you should use a LiveCD or a clean install as build platform
- If smaller binary packages are preferred, use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

cmake ../
make package


Ubuntu 8.04 needs special care:
- CMake 2.4 cannot package for Debian, so install 2.6 from backports
- Be sure not to install anything else from backports if you intend plain 8.04 package
