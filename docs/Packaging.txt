Notes about packaging, for future reference:

- If packaging a release, make sure that game/version.hh defines the version
- Make sure that the version numbers in CMakeLists.txt agree
- Preferrably you should use a LiveCD or a clean install as build platform
- If smaller binary packages are preferred, use
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCPACK_STRIP_FILES=TRUE

Source:

- Remove any extra files in source tree (the ones from SVN and build folder can be kept)

cmake ../
make package_source


Ubuntu 8.04:

- CMake 2.4 cannot package for Debian, so install 2.6 from backports
- Be sure not to install anything else from backports if you intend plain 8.04 package
- Uncomment the proper dependency line in CMakeLists.txt

cmake -DCPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME="Performous-X.Y.Z-Ubuntu8.04-i386" ../
cmake -DCPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME="Performous-X.Y.Z-Ubuntu8.04-amd64" ../
make package


Ubuntu 8.10:

- Uncomment the proper dependency line in CMakeLists.txt

cmake -DCPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME="Performous-X.Y.Z-Ubuntu8.10-i386" ../
cmake -DCPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME="Performous-X.Y.Z-Ubuntu8.10-amd64" ../
make package
