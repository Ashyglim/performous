This file lists long-time goals that are not fixable quickly. Issues that are easily
fixable should not be recorded here, but should rather be fixed in the code.

Structural:

- LibDA as a separate project
	* Also playback and Vorbis + MP3 decoding
	* Mixer and samplerate conversion inside
- Get rid of ScreenManager in favor of recursive approach?
- Switch to Clanlib?
- Switch to GStreamer? (both the ripper and the game)


Big features:

- Add compose screen (using features discussed on mailing list)
- Multiplayer duet (needs XML song format)
- Recording performances
    * Internet highscore
- Ingame Singstar DVD support (integrated ripping + ffmpeg feeding + XML song format)
- Playing and dancing
    * Guitar code from Silky Strings project (needs some love, but should be quite usable)
    * Drum code from scratch? [currently has testing mode in practice screen]
    * Dance code from scratch?
- Mic effects (reduce volume for bad singers, perfect pitch, reverb, etc)


Features:

- Auto-calibration of acoustic roundtrip latency (playback + capture)
- Better audio card configuration ingame (needs libda support for listing cards) [WIP]
- Allow playing a single song given as commandline argument (no menus)
- Kiosk/arcade mode


Ripper

- Compress into Vorbis Ogg and H.264 MKV
