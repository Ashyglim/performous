This file lists long-time goals that are not fixable quickly. Issues that are easily
fixable should not be recorded here, but should rather be fixed in the code.


Structural:

- PortAudio as the only audio backend (instead of libda plugin system) [WIP]
- Rename ScreenManager to Game and put globally used resources into it
- Switch to GStreamer? (both the ripper and the game)


Big features:

- Add compose screen (using features discussed on mailing list)
- Multiplayer duet (using FoF file format)
- Recording performances
    * Internet highscore
- Mic effects (reduce volume for bad singers, perfect pitch, reverb, etc)
- Ingame Singstar DVD support (integrated ripping + ffmpeg feeding + XML song format)


Features:

- Latency calibration
   * Audio roundtrip by analyzing the sound captured by the microphone
   * Controller/audio latency by playing blindly (listening to the beat only)
   * Audio/video by playing visually without audio? (needs controller/audio calibrated)
- Better audio card configuration ingame (needs PortAudio backend)
- Allow playing a single song given as commandline argument (no menus)
- Kiosk/arcade mode (disable exiting game and limit other functions)


Dance features:

- Colored arrows for timing
- BGCHANGE support for SM format (background videos)


Text rendering bugs:

- Correct vertical alignment
- Use dimensions to specify bounding box (possibly init from SVG)
- Lyric hilighted should be rendered in front of the others


New config menu:

- Multiple items visible at once
- Modifying strings and stringlist items.
- Predefined options from config schema and libda device enumeration


SS Ripper:

- Compress into Vorbis Ogg and H.264 MKV
- Generate FoF format


Bugs:

- Segfault when browsing songs in song browser while loading (segfaults before loading finishes), quite rare
