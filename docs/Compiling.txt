You can find songs online by Google or at your favorite Torrent sites. We
recommend starting with the ultrastar-songs package that can be download from
our project website. You need to extract that tarball into ~/.ultrastar/ or to
one of the other folders that the game searches songs for. Run ultrastar from
a terminal to see the list of folders.

If your songs are not in UTF-8 (most songs aren't yet), please do:
	recode CP1252..UTF-8 songs/*/*.txt

After that make sure that all the characters display correctly. If they don't,
you need to guess which charset the original used (instead of CP1252) and retry.

If you want to improve the game, join our IRC channel #Performous (Freenode) and
you'll get git write access.
