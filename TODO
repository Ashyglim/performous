Overall

- game name change (related to new project golas)


Structural:

- LibDA as a separate project
	* Also playback and Vorbis + MP3 decoding
	* Get rid of CAudio along with Xine/GStreamer playback deps

- Game logic in a separate thread (not in GUI thread)	

- Modular UI?

- Player stucture seperate from song etc.

Big features:

- OpenGL-based UI?
	* Much faster
	* Runtime resolution switching / resizable window
	* OpenGL rectangle pitch graph

- Video decoding with libavformat

- Add compose screen (using features discussed on mailing list)

- Multiplayer modes

- Ingame Singstar DVD support

- adding new game mode (using USB guitar, USB drums, USB carpet) to make a game more like RockBand


Features:

- Configurable audio latency (delay between screen and audio output)

- Auto-calibration of acoustic loop latency (playback + capture)

- libda device chooser/configuration for all backend


Fixes/Enhancement:

- Use cairo_surface_create_for_image instead of SDL_image

- get rid of cairo

- switch to cmake

Ripper

- remove hyphens (intelligently)

- rewrite video code

- ripping code (should be much faster)

- try to figure out what causes clicks on adpcm decoding.

Platform
 - Windows binary build
