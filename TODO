Structural:

- LibDA as a separate project
	* Also playback and Vorbis + MP3 decoding
	* Get rid of CAudio along with Xine/GStreamer playback deps

- Game logic in a separate thread (not in GUI thread)	

- Modular UI?


Big features:

- OpenGL-based UI?
	* Much faster
	* Runtime resolution switching / resizable window

- Video decoding with libavformat

- Add compose screen (using features discussed on mailing list)


Features:

- Configurable audio latency (delay between screen and audio output)
- Auto-calibration of acoustic loop latency (playback + capture)


Fixes/Enhancement:

- Use cairo_surface_create_for_image instead of SDL_image
