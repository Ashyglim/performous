Blockers for 0.3.1 release

Entries ending with question mark are optional (and not really blockers).

Text rendering (all parts optional for this release)
- Correct vertical alignment
- Use dimensions to specify bounding box (possibly init from SVG)
- Lyric hilighted should be rendered in front of the others

Configuration
- New config menu (several items visible at once, etc)
- Need to convert "~" in paths into what getenv("$HOME") gives
