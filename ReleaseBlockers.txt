Text rendering (all parts optional for this release)

- Use dimensions to specify bounding box (possibly init from SVG)
- Lyric hilighted should be rendered in front of the others

Configuration
- New config menu (several items visible at once, etc)
- Saving config to XML file?
   * Needs to store the settings within Configuration when the program is running
