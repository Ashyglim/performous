	  src/screen_practice.cpp, src/screen_sing.cpp: A lot of audio
	  cleanup. Replaced FFTW with our own "NIH" FFT, which might even
	  be faster but most importantly it is quite short and integrates
	  well with C++. There are some issues with it still, probably
	  related to phase change detection, but I'll have to look into
	  that later.

	  The only real drawback of not using FFTW is that now we are
	  limited to 2^p size FFTs, where p must be a compile-time
	  constant. The Analyzer class (renamed from CFft) now uses FFT_P
	  const variable for this, instead of fftSize. FFT_N replaces
	  fftSize.

	  We also now use boost::mutex and boost::scoped_lock, so the
	  record part of the program does not depend on SDL anymore and we
	  got rid of our NIH wrappers for SDL locks.

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, include/record.h, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/main.cpp, src/record.cpp:
	  Another huge commit... Replacing the entire capture framework
	  with a new one. Uses a kind of hack as its Makefile, but now it
	  can *try* building everything and then use all those those
	  drivers that built successfully, with runtime selection of the
	  driver to use.

	  In particular, PortAudio (both versions) and GStreamer need
	  testing. ALSA should work fine.

	  Use ultrastarng -c device or -c device:settings for choosing the
	  device, or otherwise devices will be autodetected. Examples:

	  ultrastarng -c alsa:hw:0,1 ultrastarng -c gst ultrastarng -c pa
	  ultrastarng -c pa18 ultrastarng -c ~tone ultrastarng -c
	  "~tone:440.amplitude(-20):600.phase(0.25):300" ultrastarng -c
	  none

	  You can also configure sampling rate with -r, as usual.

	  A new build-time dependency: libboost (various parts of)

	  (sorry, could not be avoided)

	  A huge patch that has accumulated all my changes from the last
	  couple of weeks :/

	  A summary follows:

	  - Optimized FFT processing: now uses only 1.0-1.3 % CPU on my
	  laptop    * Changed FFT size to 4096, step to 1500 samples
	  (previously 4800,	 1200)	  * Now uses Hamming window instead
	  of Hann (slightly better	attenuation) - Multi note detection
	  improved further    * Synchronization with SDL_mutex (wrapped in
	  C++, identically to	   Boost)    * Now can detect the notes
	  from piano playing with almost no mistakes	* Multiple
	  simultaneus singers, no problem (choirs are a mess,	   though)
	    * Guitars and violins cause many detected notes, but often the
	      singing can still be identified. Drums go virtually
	  undetected :) - Temporal filtering of tones (should recude
	  flicker)    * Probably causes more lag - please tell me if this
	  is a problem	  * Still responds quickly to pitch/dB changes	  *
	  Needs to be rewritten to make it work with small fftSteps too :(
	  - Practice screen changes    * Multiple note printout    * Uses X
	  axis for volume (can you control your voice in 2D?)	 * Uses
	  slight Y axis variations if the tone does not hit a note
	  exactly    * Printout moved one octave down, so that everything
	  really fits in      the screen and that the staff with a treble
	  clef is in correct	  position - Practice screen background of
	  theme lima modified	 * Added a separate staff with a bass clef,
	  to aid singing the lower	notes - Changed graphics main loop
	  delay to 10 ms (was 50 ms)	* Reduces latency a lot, improves
	  smoothness of animation    * Increases CPU usage significantly -
	  Added octave number and frequency to note printouts	 * Mostly
	  for debugging, but could be left in the game, too? - Peak level
	  meter (useful for checking the mic volume levels)    * Need
	  someone to add a display of this to practice/singing screens

	  - Added new compile flags to Makefile.am - Code cleanup here and
	  there, especially in record.cpp - Must get rid of all singletons
	    * Most of the reasons already pointed out in the mailing list
	   * Multiplayer requires multiple copies of objects, of which
	  singletons allow only one instance	* Work in progress...  -
	  Recording callback using C++ mechanisms    * Partially done, WIP
	  - GStreamer and PortAudio not tested, may not compile (if I made
	   mistakes) - Indentation fixes (now using tabs, previously using
	  4 or 8 spaces per   level)
