Compile:

To compile just run 'make'

Dependencies:
	- SDL SDL_Mixer SDL_ttf SDL_image SDL_gfx cairo
	- smpeg
	- FFTW
	- libalsa

Place the songs into songs/directory and put directory.mp3 directory.png and
directory.txt into it

The mp3 should be sampled at 48000Hz (use convert.sh to convert your mp3 and
be carefull it overwrite your current mp3) because SDL_Mixer doesn't resample
the mp3.

If you need Jamelia MP3 for test download it with UlstraStar (pascal/windows
version) and convert it.

Press 's' at the introduction screen to select your song

If your song is not UTF-8 encoded please do :
	iconv --from-code=ISO-8859-1 --to-code=UTF-8 source.txt dest.txt
If your song is DOS based (\r\n) please do :
	dos2unix source.txt
If you want to send a patch :
	cvs diff -NuF^f > mypatch.patch
