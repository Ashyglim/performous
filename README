You can find songs online by Google or at your favorite Torrent sites. We
recommend starting with the ultrastar-songs package that can be download from
our project website. You need to extract that tarball into ~/.ultrastar/ or to
one of the other folders that the game searches songs for. Run ultrastar from
a terminal to see a list of folders.

If your songs are not UTF-8 coded, please do:
	recode ISO-8859-1..UTF-8 songs/*/*.txt
	
If you want to send a patch :
	svn diff > mypatch.patch
